        <p style="text-indent:2em;">I was the captain of team <a href=https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/8011>8011</a> aka Guangzhou Wayi. Under my leadership, our team won a Championship and achieved the Rookie Game Changer Award in two seasons. Furthermore, I established another team <a href=https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/8811>8811</a> in Guangzhou No.2 High School with Andre Peng in 2021. I held 50 weekly studies and 3 holiday training programs for team 8811 and raised over $13,000 for sponsorship by contacting FIRST, our senior high school, and three private technological companies. I am proud of the awards I won with my very teammates:
